# Monopoly_dice
Create a program that will randomly select two numbers from 1-6 (like rolling two dice). Show the dice rolls and end the program UNLESS the program rolls doubles. If the program rolls doubles, then it should roll again, show the new roll and stop UNLESS the program rolls doubles again and so on. But on the third time you roll doubles, you don't get to roll again, on the third time you roll doubles, you go to jail!

The program should print the sum of the rolls and indicate if the user should stop or roll again or go to Jail. See the example output below.
